# Dev Considerations

Upon review, I came to an understanding that the actual state of the game is 'good enough' for what it is, an experience.
Several ideas came to mind and the more I coded the more I wanted to code. Wich then became a curse, This would never be a finished game, nothing ever is.
So, I came to peace with myself that Blob Survivors is a simple arcade game with a few features and that I received the greatest return of all, the experience that I did in fact, make a game.

So I hereby declare all further development of Blob Survivors as finished. I'm eager to make new games, other arcade stuff, maybe an rpg, eventually try to develop a 3D game. Create something from scratch.

The To-do list will be here to list implementations that I intended to do.

- Add spawn to trees (Done! - 08/07/24)
- Add more enemies (Lacking art skill to make something nice)
- Add UI to reload game (Done! - 08/07/24)
- Add Main Menu and developed a logo for the game (Done! - 08/09/24)
- Add pick up itens to alter gameplay and/or values (recover life, increase damage) (Potions done!)
- Better Understand the exe file configuration
- Added Score Count - 08/07/24
- Added Highscore to play - 08/07/24
- Fixed aiming algorithm, used YOL's version for better experience
- Add SFX for damage, Mob Death and shooting 
- Add SFX for menu interaction

## Known Bugs

- Music stops after one play, won't look into it, hopefully an easy fix
